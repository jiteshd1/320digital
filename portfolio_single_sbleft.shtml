					<h5>Checkout development - instore Kiosks</h5>
					<p >As part of Tescoâ€™s Multichannel strategy the requirement was to develop and integrate a full checkout journey on 330 touch-screen Kiosk devices allowing customers to purchase Tesco Direct products unattended in-stores.   I led the development of a proof of concept using Backbone.js and a JavaScript abstraction layer to interface with the ATG e-commerce layer to develop the checkout journey. I also led the integration of a chip and pin, barcode scanner and receipt printing devices.  The proof of concept is now production ready to be launched I October.  A significant amount of team facilitation, coaching and influencing stakeholders at Director Level was required to deliver this requirement.</p>

					<h5>Requirements gathering through outsourcing</h5>
					<p >Given the large number of EPICs on the product roadmap for 2014-15 I worked closely with the Programme Manager and the Technology Director to on-board two additional SCRUM teams through our global outsourcing partners based in the UK to work on delivering sprint-ready artefacts in time for the development teams in India.  I assessed the proposals and cost structures, as well as agreeing KPIs, team structures and deliverables.  As well as taking an active role in the vendor selection process, I also put in place a vendor onboarding plan so that there is minimal disruption to BAU work and deliverables.</p>

					<h5>Responsive web design on 6 viewports</h5>
					<p >Due to a significant increase in the number of orders placed through mobile and tablet devices the challenge was to fine tune the customer experience by developing a technical solution which supported the vast array of mobile and tablet devices used by our customers.  I delivered the end to end technical design of the solution which supports six viewports as well as the integration phase into the ATG platform through the UK SCRUM teams. </p>

					<h5>Tesco Direct Single page checkout </h5>
					<p >In order to improve conversion and to reduce the Checkout dropout rate the requirement was to merge the 5 page Tesco Direct checkout journey into a single page.

					<h5>Tesco Direct .Net platform migration to ATG</h5>
					<p>The project involved the migration of the full .Net stack to the ATG E-commerce platform.  My primary task was to build a SCRUM team in the UK focusing on the integration of the ATG E-commerce codebase delivered by an outsourcing partner in India.    Many ATG developers in the UK under my supervision were from specialist ATG third parties and Tesco's own development resources.  The migration completed in March 2012. 14 months.</p>
